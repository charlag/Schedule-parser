# Schedule parser
----
I wanted to have a proper schedule for my uni. I did it. It won't work with any
schedule, it doesn't supported merged cells but it works for me.
Feel free to hack.

It expects file '4.xls' in the current directory and generates 'schedule.ics' file.

Note: I never wrote anything serious in Ruby.

## Requirements
- Ruby 2.3+
- Bundler

## Installation
- bundler install
