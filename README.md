# Schedule parser
----
I wanted to have a proper schedule for my uni. I did it. It won't work with any
schedule, it doesn't supported merged cells but it works for me.
Feel free to hack.

It will expect file '4.xls' in the current directory and will generate 'schdeule.ics' file.

Note: I never wrote anything serious in Ruby.
